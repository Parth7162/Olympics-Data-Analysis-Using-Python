1) Getting the data and brief summary of the data
2) Investigate the variation of the data
3) Investigate the covariation of the data
4) Patterns and models (further analysis)
Using Python and Itâ€™s Libraries Like Numpy, Pandas, sklearn and Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn and give solution towards Problem.
